# MRP Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project contains the code for my master's thesis titled **"MRP Prediction Using Machine Learning"**. The goal is to predict the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of products using data-driven approaches.

## Project Overview
Retailers often struggle with optimal pricing strategies. This project uses machine learning techniques to estimate product prices based on historical data and features.

## The project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model Evaluation

## Project Structure
- `EDA_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` – Data understanding, cleaning, and transformation
- `Model-Training_Evaluation.ipynb` – ML model training, evaluation, and comparison
- `README.md` – Project overview
- `LICENSE` – Open-source license (MIT)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Charangnanappan/MRP-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Code-and-Implementation.git
   cd MRP-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Code-and-Implementation
